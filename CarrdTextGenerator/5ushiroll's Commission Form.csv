Said string is loosely tied around her pointer finger and looks like it could slip at any moment; Lots of drool in her mouth too. Next to her is a cutaway of Garn inside her neck, gripped tight by her throat and being choked by a collar of demon runes attached to the string. One hand is reaching up to grasp at his neck where the runes are, and another is reaching out to touch the walls or is pinned to his side. He looks like he’s definitely choking, but is also really enjoying the experience as Veronica swallows around him. Like always if you want to go a certain direction or change things up feel free, you know what I like!

The lighting is super dim here, only light sources are from the flickering collar around Garn’s neck, his eyes, and some natural light coming from outside the stomach. The area is cramped and Garn is being squeezed slightly, but still spacious enough for him to move around and not be super uncomfy. Walls are super slimy and juices are dripping down from the ceiling onto Garn, as well as pooling around his feet (could also glow too if you wanted to make it extra spooky). Tentacles are coming out of the walls as well, grasping onto whatever they can reach and pulling Garn up to the wall. Some are even around his neck, covering his eyes, going into his mouth, etc. Think rope bondage, but tentacles and inside a stomach. More freedom here to experiment and do what you want, or if you want to go crazy with shading it can be upgraded to a rendered bit

For this commission I would like one character, Venom. He would be sitting in a little makeshift camp on top of a mountain with a fire next to him as he is working on making himself arrows. So he would be holding some arrows in his hand while his bow is on the ground next to him. I would like for him to be wearing the outfit in the picture I provided, but his hood would be down while his mask would still be on. His breath would also be visible from the mask. There would be a small tent with him as well. The setting of this piece would be at night and for the background he would be on a partially snowy mountain so there would be a large valley that would have a medieval style city and castle in the valley lit up with torchlight. I have provided concept art of those style of cities and what they could look like! They don’t need to look like they do in the pictures. I would like to have Venom on the left side of the canvas looking out to the city and the stars in the sky. In the distant sky a galaxy could be seen as well as a shooting start fitting through the sky. That’s about all I can think of for the moment, if there’s anything else you’d like to know about the piece let me know! ","Winterwatcher318@gmail.com","I can pay with Square","Yes",""
